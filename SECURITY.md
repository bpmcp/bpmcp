# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in BPMCP, please email `security@bpmcp.dev` with the details. We ask that you:
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue when possible.
- Allow up to 72 hours for an initial response.
- Refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we confirm a fix or provide guidance.

## Supported Versions
The main branch and the latest tagged release receive security updates. Older releases may not be patched.

## Disclosure Process
1. Acknowledge receipt of the report.
2. Investigate, reproduce, and determine severity.
3. Coordinate on a fix and timeline.
4. Release a patched version and publish security notes.

Thank you for helping keep the BPMCP ecosystem secure.
