# Philosophy

## Atom → Process → Agent

- **Atoms** are focused steps that can be executed by humans, tools, or both.
- **Processes** are always modeled with **5 phases** and **5 flows** forming a single directed cycle.
- **Agents** orchestrate by reading topology and invoking provider bindings.
- **Multi-agent** flows emerge when agents hand off responsibilities based on capabilities.

This structure keeps BPMCP:
- **Human-legible** for process owners,
- **Machine-executable** for automations,
- **Vendor-comparable** via normalized bindings.
