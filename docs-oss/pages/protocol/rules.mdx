# Protocol Rules (5 + 5)

Every BPMCP process **must** satisfy the following:

- **5 phases** (`seq` 1..5, unique ids, same process_id).
- **5 flows** forming a **single directed cycle** (each phase has exactly one inbound and one outbound flow).

### Validator CLI
```bash
pnpm --filter @bpmcp/schema bpmcp-validate bundle packages/examples/seeds/bundle --bundle
```

### Recommended Phase Names
`capture`, `enrich`, `approval`, `posting`, `payment`

### Flow Guidance
- Flows link phase ids (e.g., `capture -> enrich`).
- Cycle must return to the first phase (5 edges total).
