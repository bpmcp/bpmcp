# Provider Guidelines

## Tool Naming
- Use `<provider>.<verb>[ _object ]` (e.g., `payhawk.attach_document`, `brex.attach_receipt`).
- Each tool is exposed by a provider MCP server referenced in bindings.

## Bindings
- `tool_map` keys must match the hints in atom steps (`mcp_tools`).
- Values reference provider tool identifiers.
- Bindings are scoped by `provider`, `jurisdiction`, and optional `mcp_server` labels.

## Authentication
- Keep credentials out of bindings; leverage MCP server configuration.
- Document auth expectations (API keys, OAuth scopes) alongside provider MCPs.

## Error Responses
- Return structured errors (`code`, `message`) with actionable hints.
- Avoid leaking internal stack traces or request identifiers.

## Testing
- Provide sandbox environments or mock servers whenever possible.
- Validate bindings via `pnpm seed:validate` + integration smoke tests through the Dev Gateway.
